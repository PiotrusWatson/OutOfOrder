Virginia: OMG, I had the most wonderful time over at the Made-up-a Islands. Everything was soooo exotic.
Axel: I think it's pronounced "Madeira".
Virginia: So I just had a lot of long walks on the beach and sunbathing with a Ginja Sangria in my hand. Everything I've ever wanted.
Axel: Oh nice, I love that tone, ever since I bought it I've become a really big Sangria Red guy.
Virginia: Excuse me, did you just say you own a color???
Axel: Yeah a guy in the Internet sold a picture to me just painted Sangria Red, I signed all the paperwork and it's now mine.
