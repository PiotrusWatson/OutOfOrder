Bob: boy i really am discussing things
Bob: let me talk about trains. did you know that the british rail class 07 was notorious for having the axleboxes run hot when travelling at high speed. This was initially encountered during delivery of the first locomotive, and subsequent deliveries were made by road. A later trial move of one Class 07 to Selhurst Depot for tyre profiling also resulted in overheating axlebox problems[2] and all subsequent moves of any distance, particularly those to British Rail Engineering Limited workshops, were made by road. This is in contrast to other shunter classes that would commonly have had their coupling rods removed and traction motors isolated and would then form part of a train heading in the appropriate direction. Class 08s were commonly moved in this fashion at up to 35 mph (56 km/h) â€“ overnight wagon-load trains being utilised if possible.
